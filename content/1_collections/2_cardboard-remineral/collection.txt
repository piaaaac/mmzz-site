Text1: During my BA I developed a strong interest for non-precious materials, how to transform and repurpose them. This piece was entirely made out of three cardboard tubes, sliced and treated with several color waxes. Its aesthetic was influenced by African and tribal colourful Jewellery, however it gains new and contemporary Value for the material and process it was created with.

Text2: Each slices has its own strong identity, resembling natural-looking patterns like wood, marble and rock. Roughly 50 of them come together as an extremely bold, light and playful statement piece.
