Introtext: The piece Celestial Body is an exploration and celebration of the material tinplate and its transformation. Once under a strong flame, it reveals extraordinary, unexpected properties one would not associate with a non-precious material.

Text1: Beautiful, accidental shapes and colors appear in a very unpredictable way, depending on the strength of the heat source. All the different patterns created by the enamel colors that were already present on the metal generate a fluid, harmonic body that naturally takes the name of ‘Celestial Body’ as it reminds me of the colors of the planets in the galaxy.
