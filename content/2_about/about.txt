Text:

Matilde Mozzanega is a jewellery designer from Milan currently based in Florence. Recently graduated from Central Saint Martins, BA Jewellery Design, she is now attending her MFA in Contemporary Jewellery & Body ornament in Alchimia, Contemporary Jewellery School. 

Her work sits within the context of sustainability and recycling. She is in fact interested in the qualities of non-precious materials, how to transform and repurpose them.

Her graduate collection from CSM, Cardboard Cutouts, is exploration of the uncanny transformative and magical properties of industrial cardboard tubing.

Specifically, through an upcycling process, she mimics natural materials out of the same cardboard tube, taking what is conventional far afield: driftwood, stone, marble, bamboo and ceramic are the main features which this polymorphic material assumes.

The material goes back to ‘what it used to be’ as in an alchemical cycle for where matter goes back to its primordial state. 

The tension between a ubiquitous, everyday seen/used material and its physical transformation, by going beyond its limits, are the aspects that fascinate her the most about working with what can be defined the most non-precious of the non-precious materials.
