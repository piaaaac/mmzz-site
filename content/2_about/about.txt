Text:

Her work sits within the context of Contemporary Jewellery & Sustainability. She is in fact interested in the qualities of non-precious materials, how to transform and repurpose them. The main medium she works with is Industrial cardboard tubing, which through a process of utter metamorphosis, goes back to what is used to be, like in an alchemical cycle for which matter goes back to its original form. 

The deceptive nature of her work disrupts the jewellery and design landscape, celebrating high levels of craftsmanship and passion for making. The result is a unique product, that sits between the field of contemporary jewellery and organic, sculptural wearable art.

The tension between a ubiquitous, everyday seen/used material and its physical transformation, with going beyond its limits, are the aspects that fascinates her the most about working with what can be defined - the most non-precious of the non-precious materials. 

Her work pushes the limits of what jewellery can be and it constantly questions our contemporary idea of Value and materiality. She strongly believes that all materials are equal now: the accent is on the quality of what one does, how the idea is expressed and the reason behind it. It is all about craftsmanship and clarity of an idea.
