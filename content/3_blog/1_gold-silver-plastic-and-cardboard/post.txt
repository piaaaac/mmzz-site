"One of the students is taking objects that you’d expect to see carved out of stone or wood and making them from recycled cardboard tubes. It’s that kind of refinement; the magic of getting to know a material and a process, that forms the foundation for setting up your own business or your own design identity. The excitement is that it’s all equal now."
